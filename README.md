# Advanced-Military-Ultrasonic-Radar-Monitor-Project📡

Radar (Radio Detection And Ranging) is an object detection system that 
uses radio waves or microwaves to determine object distance(ranging), 
angle and radial velocity of that object. This Advanced Ultrasonic Arduino 
Radar system can be used to monitor local patch area and can also scan 
suspicious object. One can remotely control a car having explosive material 
in it. With the help of this Arduino sonar radar project we can prevent the 
enemies to reach the public and thus many lives can be saved. This Arduino sonar project system continuously scans the area and gives a 
beep sound on detecting an object, simultaneously, the radar provides the 
angle as well as distance of the object from our source. Our system helps in 
tracking the exact position and trace the path followed by the object.

## Features✨

✔ It transmits the sound of the object so color or transparency can't affect it's mechanism. 

✔ It'll work perfectly at night and in heavy rain.

✔ It has high frequency, high sensitivity so it's efficiency is very high.

✔ Even if anyone comes close, it'll not be harmful for human being or any type of animals.
